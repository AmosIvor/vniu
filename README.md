**Description**: In today's world, the need to enhance the shopping experience has become essential. With the rapid advancement of AI technology, it has become possible to support users effectively during their shopping journeys. VNIU is an
advanced AI application designed to elevate the online shopping experience. VNIU integrates features such as image-based product search, allowing users to simply snap a photo of a product and find similar items. Additionally, VNIU's intelligent chatbot assists users in answering any questions quickly and accurately. VNIU promises to deliver the most convenient and efficient shopping experience.

**How to use**:

### `1. Init react-native project`

#### Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

##### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

##### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

###### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

###### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

##### Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

##### Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
